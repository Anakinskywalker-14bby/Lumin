          <strong>The short version:</strong> we collect your email and your
          skin quiz answers. That&apos;s it. No payment, no card details. We
          don&apos;t sell your data. You can ask us to delete everything at any
          time and we will.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>What we collect</h2>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>When you join the waitlist</h3>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Your email address, and a one-way hash of your IP address plus your
        browser&apos;s user-agent string. The hash lets us block spam and abuse
        without storing your actual IP address.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>When you complete the skin quiz</h3>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Your first name, age range, gender, and your answers about your skin:
        skin type, sensitivity, main concern, breakout patterns, routine
        preference, lifestyle, climate, any treatments you&apos;re using,
        pregnancy or breastfeeding status, known allergies, and roughly what
        you spend monthly.
      </p>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Some of these answers say something about your health. We treat them as
        sensitive information: they exist to personalize your recommendations
        and nothing else. We do not sell them, we do not share them with
        advertisers, and we do not use them to make decisions about you beyond
        which products to suggest.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>What we do with it</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        We use your email to confirm your spot, tell you when your scan is
        ready, and send occasional product updates. We use your quiz answers to
        build your skin profile and match you with products. We use aggregate,
        de-identified patterns (for example, &ldquo;38% of our waitlist has
        combination skin&rdquo;) to decide what to build first.
      </p>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        We share data only with the vendors that run Lumin: Supabase (database
        hosting), Vercel (site hosting), and Resend (email delivery). They
        process data on our behalf under their own terms. We do not sell or
        rent personal information to anyone.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>How long we keep it</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Waitlist and quiz data is kept while your entry is active and for up to
        24 months after your last interaction with us, after which it is
        deleted or irreversibly anonymized. Unverified signups (where you never
        clicked the confirmation link) are deleted after 90 days. Verification
        links themselves expire after 7 days.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>Future scan data</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Face scans are not collected today. When the Lumin app launches, scans
        will be governed by a separate, explicit consent step shown before any
        photo is taken. Our standing commitments: your photo is used to
        generate your results, we will not use it to train models without a
        separate opt-in you can decline, and you will be able to delete it.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>Your rights</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        You can ask us to show you your data, correct it, or delete it, and you
        can withdraw consent or unsubscribe at any time using the link in any
        email we send. Depending on where you live (for example the UK, EU,
        California, or Australia) you may have additional rights including data
        portability and the right to complain to your local regulator. We
        honour these requests regardless of where you live.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>Cookies</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Lumin does not use advertising or tracking cookies. We store a single
        local preference recording your cookie-banner choice so we don&apos;t
        ask you twice. If we add analytics later, it will only load after you
        opt in, and this page will be updated first.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>Children</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Lumin is intended for people 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect
        information from children. If you believe a minor has given us data,
        contact us and we will delete it.
      </p>

      <h2 style={h2Style}>Contact &amp; changes</h2>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        A dedicated support address is being set up and will be published here.
        In the meantime you can reply to any email you receive from Lumin to
        reach us, including for access or deletion requests. If we change this
        policy materially, we will say so by email before the change takes
        effect.
